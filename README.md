## Advanced CSS Course Projects
____

These 3 projects are all about modern css possibilities and using sass. The big part of projects is responsive design:    
✅ mobile-first vs desktop-first    
✅ writing media queries with sass mixins    
✅ relative units (rem, em, vw, fr and etc.)    
✅ using possibilities of flexbox and grid for responsiveness    

Some global structure and setup added for easier viewing.
